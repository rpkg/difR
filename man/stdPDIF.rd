\title{Standardization DIF statistic}

\description{
  Calculates standardized P-difference statistics for DIF detection. 
 }

\usage{
 stdPDIF(data, member, anchor=1:ncol(data), stdWeight="focal")
 }
 
\arguments{
 \item{data}{numeric: the data matrix (one row per subject, one column per item).}
 \item{member}{numeric: the vector of group membership with zero and one entries only. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{anchor}{a vector of integer values specifying which items (all by default) are currently considered as anchor (DIF free) items. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{stdWeight}{character: the type of weights used for the standardized P-DIF statistic. Possible values are \code{"focal"} (default),
                  \code{"reference"} and \code{"total"}. See \bold{Details}.}
}

\value{
A list with two arguments:
 \item{resStd}{the vector of the standardized P-DIF statistics.}
 \item{resAlpha}{the vector of standardized alpha values.}
 }
 
\details{
 This command computes the standardized P-DIF statistic in the specific framework of differential item functioning (Dorans and Kullick, 1986). It forms the basic command 
 of \code{\link{difStd}} and is specifically designed for this call. In addition, the standardized alpha values (Dorans, 1989) are also computed
 as a basis for effect size calculation.

 The standardized P-DIF statistic is a weighted average of the difference in proportions of successes in the reference group and in the focal group.
 The average is computed accross the test score strata. The weights can be of three kinds (Dorans, 1989; Dorans and Kullick, 1986) and are specified through the \code{stdWeight} argument: 
 the proportion of focal groups examinees within each stratum (\code{stdWeight="focal"}), the proportion of reference group examinees within each stratum (\code{stdWeight="reference"}), 
 and the proportion of examinees (from both groups) within each stratum (\code{stdWeight="total"}). By default, the weights are built from the focal group. 
 
 Similarly to the 'alpha' estimates of the common odds ratio for the Mantel-Haenszel method (see \code{\link{mantelHaenszel}}), the \emph{standardized alpha values} can be
 computed as rough measures of effect sizes, after a transformation to the Delta Scale (Holland, 1985). See Dorans (1989, p.228, Eqn.15) for
 further details. 
 
 The data are passed through the \code{data} argument, with one row per subject and one column per item. Missing values are not allowed.
  
 The vector of group membership, specified with \code{member} argument, must hold only zeros and ones, a value of zero corresponding to the
 reference group and a value of one to the focal group.
 
 Option \code{anchor} sets the items which are considered as anchor items for computing standardized P-DIF statistics. Items other than the anchor items and the tested item 
 are discarded. \code{anchor} must hold integer values specifying the column numbers of the corresponding anchor items. It is mainly designed to perform item purification.
